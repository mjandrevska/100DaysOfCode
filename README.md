# About the project
100 Days of code - 100 Projects is a challenge for improving the coding skills.

# Purpose
I'm joining the challenge in order to improve my coding and UI/UX skills by building a lot of different projects. Through the journey, i will use different technologies and frameworks.

# Ideas
Most of the ideas are borrowed from: https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/2019/09/100-days-100-projects/, but I will slightly change some of them and add additional ideas.

# Rules
Although the official rule is that you have to complete 1 project per day and spend at least 1 hour programming, I will focus on quality over quantity and  extend the time for completing some of the more complex projects or take more time for learning new technologies.

# Projects
1. Project 1 (folder - Day1-RandomMealGenerator)- Random Meal Generator - A simple project for generating random meals with more information about the meals by clicking on a button. Technologies: Angular

2. Project 2 (folder - day2) - Testimonials - A project for displaying testimonials by clients. Technologies: React-Create-App and Chakra UI
